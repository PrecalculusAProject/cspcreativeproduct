    <h1>IB Group 4 CSP – Interdisciplinary Project</h1>
    <p>Exploring How School Design Affects Human-Environment Interactions</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Statement of Inquiry</h2>
    <p>To what extent does the design of North Atlanta High School contribute to positive interactions between human society and the environment?</p>

    <h2>Interdisciplinary Connection</h2>
    <p>This project brings together insights from Physics, Biology, and Sports & Exercise Health Science (SEHS). Each discipline conducted an experiment that contributes to a unified understanding of how the physical design of our school environment affects student well-being, behavior, and environmental interaction.</p>

    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p><strong>Research Question:</strong> How does the layout and surface type of school hallways affect students' walking speed and acceleration?</p>
    <p><strong>Variables:</strong> Independent – surface type; Dependent – speed/acceleration; Controlled – distance, time of day, participants</p>
    <p><strong>Method:</strong> Students walked 10m on tile, carpet, and concrete surfaces. Times were recorded and speeds/accelerations calculated.</p>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Surface</th><th>Avg. Time (s)</th><th>Speed (m/s)</th><th>Acceleration (m/s²)</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Tile</td><td>6.1</td><td>1.64</td><td>0.27</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Carpet</td><td>6.9</td><td>1.45</td><td>0.21</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Concrete</td><td>5.7</td><td>1.75</td><td>0.31</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <div class="graph">
      <canvas id="speedChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Surface type influences student speed, which impacts movement flow and energy use in the school environment.</p>

    <h2>Biology</h2>
    <p><strong>Research Question:</strong> How does noise pollution in different school zones affect students' physiological stress responses?</p>
    <p><strong>Variables:</strong> Independent – location; Dependent – heart rate; Controlled – same individuals, time of day</p>
    <p><strong>Method:</strong> Students measured heart rates in quiet (library) and noisy (cafeteria, hallway) areas using fitness trackers. Noise levels were recorded with a decibel meter app.</p>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Location</th><th>Noise Level (dB)</th><th>Avg. Heart Rate (bpm)</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Library</td><td>42</td><td>68</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hallway</td><td>74</td><td>78</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Cafeteria</td><td>85</td><td>84</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Louder environments are associated with higher heart rates, suggesting a stress response linked to school design.</p>

    <h2>Sports & Exercise Health Science (SEHS)</h2>
    <p><strong>Research Question:</strong> How does air quality in different school areas impact cardiovascular performance during exercise?</p>
    <p><strong>Variables:</strong> Independent – location; Dependent – post-exercise heart rate; Controlled – same exercise, same participants</p>
    <p><strong>Method:</strong> Students performed light cardio in the gym, classroom, and outside. Air quality (CO₂/PM2.5) was measured, and heart rate was recorded post-exercise.</p>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Location</th><th>CO₂ (ppm)</th><th>Post-Exercise Heart Rate (bpm)</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Gym</td><td>850</td><td>142</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Classroom</td><td>1100</td><td>152</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Outside</td><td>430</td><td>138</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Better air quality correlates with lower heart rates post-exercise, suggesting outdoor areas are more conducive to healthy physical activity.</p>

    <h2>Challenges & Suggestions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Controlling time of day and hallway traffic was difficult. Next time, block off testing areas.</li>
      <li>Biology participants had noisy surroundings; suggest using noise-canceling equipment for more accurate readings.</li>
      <li>Air quality sensors had slight lag; allow time for readings to stabilize in future.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The design of school environments—including surface materials, acoustic levels, and air quality—clearly influences physical, physiological, and behavioral outcomes in students. Each subject demonstrated how design decisions shape human-environment interactions. This webpage integrates our findings into an accessible, creative digital product aligned with the inquiry.</p>
